# Aegisub Flatpak

ðŸ“¦ Flatpak Package of Aegisub for Linux

Aegisub is a free, cross-platform open source tool for creating and modifying subtitles. Aegisub makes it quick and easy to time subtitles to audio, and features many powerful tools for styling them, including a built-in real-time video preview.

This is the fork by wangqr packaged as a flatpak: <https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub/>
You can find the upstream version here: <https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub/>

There is also an old upstream version with some patches packaged as a flatpak.
This is not affiliated with it and completely made from scratch.

Differences compared to <https://github.com/scx/aegisub-flatpak>:

- fully based on wangqr fork (<https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub>)
- more up to date dependencies
- latest freedesktop runtime (21.08) instead of old gnome (3.34)
- follows gtk theme on gnome if available for flatpak
- smaller size (bundle: 12MB vs 82MB)
- can actually be built

## Known issues

- Weird issues with some video/audio files (bad quality, out of sync), also happens for me when built from source (<https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub>), from the AUR: aegisub-git (<https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub>) and in the package on RPM Fusion

- Aegisub uses the default Adwaita theme on KDE
